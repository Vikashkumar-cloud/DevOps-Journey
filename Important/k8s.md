# Day 5 — Architecture Revision Questions 

## Q1. Explain Kubernetes architecture and its major components.

Kubernetes architecture consists of two main parts:

## Control Plane:- 
The Control Plane manages the cluster state and includes components like 

### API Server:- 
API Server is the main gatekeeper of Kubernetes. To communicate between two Kubernetes resources/components, the communication goes through API Server.
### etcd:- 
etcd is like a database in Kubernetes. It stores all the cluster information in key-value format, such as: Nodes, Pods, Deployments.
### Scheduler:- 
Scheduler decides on which Worker Node the new Pod will run, based on available resources.
### Controller Manager:- 
Controller Manager continuously checks the current and desired state of the cluster. If there is any mismatch, it takes action to match the current state with the desired state.


## Worker Nodes:- 
Worker Nodes are where our application runs and include 

### kubelet:- 
Kubelet is an agent running on every Worker Node. Its main job is to make sure all assigned Pods and containers are running properly on that Worker Node.
### Container runtime :- 
Container Runtime is responsible for creating and running containers inside the Pod.
### kube-proxy:- 
kube-proxy manages network traffic and sends Service traffic to the correct Pod.


## Q2. Explain the complete flow when you run: kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx from kubectl → API Server → etcd → Scheduler → kubelet → container. 

When we run a kubectl command, the request first goes to the API Server. API Server validates the request and stores the desired state in etcd. Scheduler identifies a suitable Worker Node for the Pod. After that kubelet on the selected node communicates with the container runtime to pull the image and run the container.

## Q3. A Pod is created but remains Pending. Which Kubernetes architecture component is responsible for selecting the node, and how would you troubleshoot it? 

kube-scheduler is responsible for assigning Pods to Worker Nodes. If a Pod is stuck in Pending state, I will first check ****kubectl describe pod**** events to identify the reason. Then I will check node resources,  and scheduling constraints to find why the scheduler is unable to assign the Pod

## Q4. What happens when a worker node becomes NotReady?

First I will check node status using ****kubectl get nodes****, then ****kubectl describe node**** to check events. After that I will verify kubelet status, kubelet logs, container runtime and node resource/network issues


# 1. Pod Pending

### Q1. A Pod is stuck in Pending state. How will you troubleshoot it?

For a Pending Pod, I will first run ****kubectl describe pod <pod-name>**** and check the Events section. Then I will verify node status using ****kubectl get nodes****, check resource availability using ****kubectl top nodes****, review scheduling constraints like node selectors and taints, and check PVC status if storage is involved. Based on the error message, I will fix the root cause.

### Q2. A Pod is Pending because the cluster does not have enough CPU/memory. How will you identify and resolve it?

First, I will run ****kubectl describe pod <pod-name>**** and check Events for insufficient CPU or memory errors. Then I will check node capacity using ****kubectl describe node**** and utilization using ****kubectl top nodes****. If resource requests are too high, I will optimize them. Otherwise, I will increase cluster capacity by adding more Worker Nodes or scaling resources.

### Q3. A Pod is Pending even though the nodes have enough resources. What Kubernetes scheduling-related things will you check?

If a Pod is Pending despite available resources, I will first check ****kubectl describe pod <pod-name>**** events. Then I will verify scheduling rules like nodeSelector, node affinity, taints and tolerations, and resource requests. The Scheduler places a Pod only when all scheduling conditions are satisfied.

# 2. CrashLoopBackOff

### Q4. A Pod is showing CrashLoopBackOff. What will you check first and how will you troubleshoot it?

For CrashLoopBackOff means the container is starting and repeatedly crashing, I first check ****kubectl describe pod**** and container logs using ****kubectl logs --previous**** to identify why the container is crashing. Then I check exit codes, application configuration, environment variables, probes and dependencies. After identifying the root cause, I fix the configuration or application issue and redeploy.

### Q5. A container starts and immediately exits. How will you identify the root cause?

If a container starts and immediately exits, I will first check ****kubectl logs**** and ****kubectl describe pod**** to identify the exit reason. Then I will verify the container command, arguments, application configuration, environment variables and external dependencies. Based on the error, I will fix the issue and redeploy the Pod.

### Q6. A Pod was running earlier but now shows CrashLoopBackOff. How will you check logs from the previous container instance?

For a Pod in CrashLoopBackOff, I will use ****kubectl logs <pod-name> --previous**** to check logs from the previous crashed container instance. I will also check ****kubectl describe pod**** for exit codes and termination reasons to identify the root cause

### Q7. A Pod is getting OOMKilled and then entering CrashLoopBackOff. How will you troubleshoot it?

For an OOMKilled Pod, I will first confirm the issue using ****kubectl describe pod**** and check the termination reason. Then I will check memory usage using kubectl top pod, review memory requests and limits, and check node resources. Based on the root cause, I will increase memory limits or optimize the application.

# 3. ImagePullBackOff / ErrImagePull

### Q8. A Pod is showing ImagePullBackOff. How will you troubleshoot it?

ImagePullBackOff means Kubernetes is unable to pull the container image. First, I will check Pod events to identify the image pull error, then verify image name, registry access and authentication.

### Q9. The Deployment was created successfully, but Pods are showing ErrImagePull. What will you check?

If Deployment is created successfully but Pods show ErrImagePull, it means the Deployment configuration is accepted but the Pod is unable to pull the container image. I will check Pod events, image name/tag, registry access and authentication.

### Q10. The application image is stored in a private registry and the Pod cannot pull it. How will you troubleshoot it?

If a Pod cannot pull an image from a private registry, I will first check Pod events, verify registry credentials, check imagePullSecrets configuration and confirm that the node has access to the registry
