# What is Ansible?

Ansible is an automation and configuration-management tool.

We use it to automate tasks across multiple servers, such as:

Installing packages
Starting/stopping services
Copying files
Changing configurations
Creating users
Deploying applications

For example, if you have 20 Linux servers and need to install Nginx on all of them, instead of connecting to each server manually, Ansible can automate the task.

```
                 Ansible
                Controller
                    |
          ---------------------
          |         |         |
       Server 1  Server 2  Server 3
```

Ansible is agentless.

That means we normally do not install an Ansible agent on the managed Linux servers.

For Linux, Ansible commonly connects using SSH.

```
Ansible Controller
       |
       | SSH
       ↓
Managed Linux Server
```

# Controller Node vs Managed Node

### 1. Controller Node

The Controller Node is the machine from which you run Ansible.

For example:

```
Your Linux/EC2 machine
        ↓
Ansible installed here
        ↓
You run Ansible commands
```

It contains things like:

Ansible
Inventory
Playbooks
Configuration
SSH keys/credentials

### 2. Managed Node

Managed Nodes are the target servers that Ansible configures or manages

```
                Controller
              10.0.1.10
                   |
             SSH connection
          _____ ___|_____
         ↓     ↓         ↓
      Web-1  Web-2     DB-1
```

# Inventory

An inventory is a file that contains information about the servers managed by Ansible.

```
[webservers]
web1 ansible_host=10.0.1.20
web2 ansible_host=10.0.1.21

[dbservers]
db1 ansible_host=10.0.1.30
```

# How Ansible Connects to Linux Servers

The Controller's public key should be present in the Managed Node's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file, and the Controller keeps the corresponding private key.

```
Controller                         Managed Node
   |                                    |
   | Private key                         |
   |-------------------- SSH ---------->|
   |                                    |
   |                         authorized_keys
   |                         contains matching
   |                         public key
   |                                    |
   |<--------- Authentication ---------->|
```

# Start Lab

## Install Ansible

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible-core -y
ansible --version
```

```
nano inventory

[webservers]

web1 ansible_host=172.31.0.240

```
```
ansible -i inventory webservers -m ping
```

# Ansible Modules.

A module is the Ansible tool that performs a specific task on managed nodes.

ping, command, shell, apt, service, copy and so on

```
ping → connectivity check
command → simple Linux command
shell → shell features ke saath command
apt → package management
service → service management
copy → file copy
file → file/directory create/delete/permissions


```
Command:- ansible -i inventory webservers -m command -a "df -h"
Shell:- ansible -i inventory webservers -m shell -a "df -h | grep /boot"
Script:- ansible -i inventory webservers -m script -a "test.sh"
Copy:- ansible -i inventory webservers -m copy -a "src=test.txt dest=/tmp/test.txt"
File:- ansible -i inventory webservers -m file -a "path=/tmp/mydir state=directory" state=touch
Apt:- ansible -i inventory webservers -m apt -a "name=nginx state=present" --become
Service:- ansible -i inventory webservers -m service -a "name=nginx state=started" --become
User:- ansible -i inventory webservers -m user -a "name=devuser state=present" --become
Group: ansible -i inventory webservers -m group -a "name=developers state=present" --become
```

# Ad-hoc Command

An ad-hoc command is a single Ansible command used to perform one task immediately, without creating a playbook.

```
ansible -i inventory webservers -m command -a "uptime"
```

# Ansible Playbook

Ansible Playbook is a YAML file where we define the tasks that Ansible should perform on managed servers.

```
---
- name: Install tree
  hosts: webservers
  become: true
  tasks:
   - name: Install tree
     apt:
      name: tree
      state: present

   - name: Create a directory
     file:
      path: /tmp/ansible-demo
      state: directory

```

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
```

# Ansible Variables

A variable is simply a name that stores a value.

```
---
- name: Install tree
  hosts: webservers
  become: true
  vars:
   package_name: tree
  tasks:
   - name: Install tree
     apt:
      name: "{{ package_name }}"
      state: present
```

# debug  

debug is an Ansible module used to display information/output while the playbook is running.

msg means message — what you want Ansible to display.

```
---
- name: Install htop
  hosts: webservers
  become: true
  vars:
   package_name: htop
   directory_path: /tmp/learn-demo


  tasks:
   - name: Install tree
     apt:
      name: "{{ package_name }}"
      state: present


   - name: Create a directory
     file:
      path: "{{ directory_path }}"
      state: directory

   - name: Show package name
     debug:
      msg: "{{ package_name }}"


```

# when

In Ansible, when is used to run a task only when a condition is true.

```
---
- name: Install docker
  hosts: webservers
  become: true
  vars:
   package_name: htop
  


  tasks:
   - name: Install docker
     apt:
      name: "{{ package_name }}"
      state: present
     when:
      - ansible_facts['distribution'] == "CentOS"
      - package_name == "docker.io"

```

# loop

loop is used to repeat the same task for multiple items.

```

---
 - name: Install package
   hosts: webservers
   become: true

   tasks:

    - name: Install package
      apt:
       name: "{{ item }}"
       state: present
      loop:
        - git
        - curl
```

# Handler

A special Ansible task that runs only when another task makes a change.
notify tells Ansible which Handler should run when the task changes.	


```
---
- name: Configure nginx
  hosts: webservers
  become: true

  tasks:

    - name: Copy nginx configuration
      copy:
        src: nginx.conf
        dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      notify: Restart nginx

  handlers:

    - name: Restart nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted
```

# # Fact:-

automatically collected information about the managed node.

```
---
- name: Check Server Facts
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Show all facts
      debug:
        var: ansible_facts
```	

# Jinja Template

A template is used when we want to create the same type of configuration on many servers, but some values need to be different for each server.

Example:-

Suppose you have 100 servers and you want to create an application configuration on all of them.
Most of the configuration is the same, but the application port is different:
Instead of creating 100 different configuration files, we create one template and use variables for the values that change.
Ansible uses that one template and creates the appropriate configuration on each server.

### Inventory

[servers]
s1 ansible_host=1.1.1.1 app_port=8080
s2 ansible_host=2.2.2.2 app_port=8081

### app.conf.j2

APP_NAME=ShopSphere
DB_HOST=10.0.0.50
DB_NAME=shopdb
PORT={{ app_port }}
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

### Playbook

---
- name: Create application config
  hosts: servers

  tasks:
    - name: Create config file
      template:
        src: app.conf.j2
        dest: /tmp/app.conf



# Ansible Role:

Ansible Roles are used to organize playbooks and related files into a structured, reusable directory structure.

The six components are:

myapp/
├── tasks/
│   └── main.yml
├── handlers/
│   └── main.yml
├── templates/
├── files/
├── vars/
│   └── main.yml
└── defaults/
    └── main.yml


taks/main.yml

- name: Install nginx
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present

playbook.yml

- name: Configure application
  hosts: servers
  roles:
    - myapp

To create a role:- ansible-galaxy role init myapp

ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml


# import_role vs include_role

import_role is static and processed at parse time, whereas include_role is dynamic and processed at runtime.

- name: Install Nginx
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present

- name: Run application role
  import_role:
    name: myapp

- name: Install Docker
  apt:
    name: docker.io
    state: present



# Ansible Vault

Ansible Vault is a feature in Ansible used to encrypt sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and credentials so that secrets are not stored in plain text.

ansible-vault create secrets.yml

ansible-vault edit secrets.yml

ansible-vault view secrets.yml

ansible-vault decrypt secrets.yml


- hosts: servers
  vars_files:
    - secrets.yml

  tasks:
    - name: Show password
      debug:
        msg: "{{ db_password }}"

ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass

# What is Ansible?

Ansible is an automation and configuration management tool used to automate tasks such as:

Server configuration
Package installation
Service management
User creation
Application deployment
Configuration changes

Ansible is agentless and typically uses SSH to communicate with Linux managed nodes.

# Ansible Architecture

Ansible mainly has two sides:

Control Node and Managed Nodes

The Control Node is where Ansible is installed and where we execute commands or playbooks. Managed Nodes are the target servers that Ansible configures or manages. Ansible is agentless and typically communicates with Linux servers using SSH.

# Agentless + SSH

Ansible is agentless, which means we normally don't need to install an Ansible agent on the managed Linux servers. The Control Node connects to the managed nodes using SSH and executes the required tasks or modules remotely.

# Inventory

Ansible Inventory is a list of servers or groups on which we can execute Ansible commands.

```
[webservers]
web01 ansible_host=192.168.1.10
web02 ansible_host=192.168.1.11

[dbservers]
db01 ansible_host=192.168.1.20
```

# Inventory Hands-on

## Install Ansible

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible-core -y
ansible --version
```

## Create inventory file

```
mkdir -p ~/ansible
cd ~/ansible
nano inventory

[webservers]
server1 ansible_host=172.31.0.240 ansible_user=ubuntu
```
```
ansible -i webservers -m ping
```

# Ad-hoc Commands

Ad-hoc command is used to perform a quick, one-time task on one or more managed servers without creating a playbook.

```
ansible -i inventory webservers -m command -a "uptime"
```

# Ansible Modules.

A module is the Ansible tool that performs a specific task on managed nodes.

ping, command, shell, apt, service, copy and so on
```
ping → connectivity check
command → simple Linux command
shell → shell features ke saath command
apt → package management
service → service management
copy → file copy
file → file/directory create/delete/permissions
```
## command vs shell Module

The command module runs commands directly without using the shell. The shell module runs commands through the shell and supports shell features like pipes and redirection. I prefer the command module when shell features are not required.

```
ansible -i inventory webservers -m command -a "df -h"
ansible -i inventory webservers -m shell -a "df -h | grep /boot"
```

# Playbook

An Ansible Playbook is a YAML file where we define the tasks that Ansible should perform on managed servers.

```
playbook.yml
---
- name: My First Playbook
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Check hostname
      command: hostname
    - name: Check uptime and Disk status
      shell: "uptime && df -h"
```

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
```

```
# Variable

---
- name: My First Playbook
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  vars:
     package_name: nginx
  tasks:
    - name: Check hostname
      command: hostname
      register: result
    - name: Show hostname
      debug:
        var: result
    - name: Install package
      apt:
        name: "{{ package_name }}"
        state: present
        update_cache: yes

```

# Fact:-

automatically collected information about the managed node.

```
---
- name: Check Server Facts
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Show all facts
      debug:
        var: ansible_facts
```

# When:- 

is used for conditional task execution in Ansible. If the condition evaluates to true, the task runs; otherwise, Ansible skips the task.

```
---
- name: Check Server Facts
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Show all info
      debug:
        var: ansible_facts.distribution
    - name: Create test file on Ubuntu
      file:
        path: /tmp/ansible-test
        state: touch
      when: ansible_facts.distribution == "Ubuntu"
```

# Loop: 

A loop is used when we need to perform the same task for multiple items, instead of writing the same task repeatedly.

```
---
- name: Loop Example
  hosts: webservers

  tasks:
    - name: Create test files
      file:
        path: "/tmp/{{ item }}"
        state: touch
      loop:
        - file1
        - file2
        - file3
```

```
---
- name: Install Multiple Packages
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Install packages
      apt:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
        update_cache: yes
      loop:
        - nginx
        - git
        - curl
```


# Templates (Jinja2): 

Jinja2 is used in Ansible to create template files where we can insert variable values dynamically.

For example, we can use {{ server_name }} in a template, and Ansible will replace it with the actual server name while creating the configuration file.
